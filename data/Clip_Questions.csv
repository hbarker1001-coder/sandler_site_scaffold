why-have-a-system,clip-01,1,"Q: Why are open-ended questions alone not sufficient as a selling system?
A: Because prospects quickly learned how to close those questions themselves, meaning that just asking questions does not give the salesperson control over the sales process."
why-have-a-system,clip-01,2,"Q: What is the main reason for these problems with prospects?
A: The main reason is that prospects have become familiar with conventional selling techniques and have learned to control the sales process, making them less responsive to traditional methods."
why-have-a-system,clip-02,3,"Q: Why did the Air Force lieutenant ask about the reliability of the T-38 ejection seat system?

A: He said that 117 pilots ejected and all 117 survived, but 23 people had been killed flying the airplane because they didn't eject."
why-have-a-system,clip-03,5,"Q: What is the most obvious reason for using a selling system?
A: The most obvious reason for using a selling system is that it is a process designed to lead you through the sales call, keeping you on track and focused by knowing where you are and where you're going next."
why-have-a-system,clip-03,6,"Q: How does a selling system help in recognizing and dealing with problems during the sales process?
A: It allows you to recognize potential problems earlier in the process so you can make timely changes, and it provides guidelines for dealing with problems that prospects throw your way."
why-have-a-system,clip-04,7,"Q: What are the two systems at work when prospects and salespeople begin the buyer-seller interaction?
A: The two systems are the prospect system and the salesperson system."
why-have-a-system,clip-04,8,"Q: According to David Sandler, why do salespeople fail?
A: Salespeople fail because they have little control over what takes place during sales calls and are often unaware of the manipulative measures prospects use."
why-have-a-system,clip-05,9,"Q: What is the first step in the Sandler selling process regarding how prospects handle information?
A: In the first step, prospects keep their cards close to the vest and do not reveal their issues, budgets, or decision processes quickly to avoid losing leverage and being taken advantage of. This is a form of self-protection."
why-have-a-system,clip-05,10,"Q: Why is the presentation and proposal stage often a trap for salespeople?
A: Salespeople spend a lot of time and energy preparing proposals and presentations, but prospects may have no real interest or commitment, using the information to shop around and gain leverage without intending to buy."
why-have-a-system,clip-06,11,"Q: What inspired David Sandler to use the submarine metaphor?
A: David Sandler was inspired by old John Wayne black and white movies about submarines from World War II, where scenes showed the crew moving through different compartments inside the submarine."
why-have-a-system,clip-06,12,"Q:How does the submarine metaphor relate to the sales call process?
A: In the sales call, the idea is to take a prospect through one compartment to the next, and once they move forward, the previous compartment is 'filled with water' so they can't go back, symbolizing progressing through the sales stages without retreat."
why-have-a-system,clip-07,13,"Q: What does David Sandler refer to as the 'caveman approach' to selling?
A: The 'caveman approach' refers to the traditional selling method from the 1960s where salespeople gave energetic presentations, closed for the order, handled stalls and objections repeatedly, often leaving both salesperson and prospect exhausted."
why-have-a-system,clip-07,14,"Q: Why does Sandler emphasize finding out the prospect's pain?
A: Because people buy either to feel good or to relieve pain, and it is easier to sell to people who are in pain or have problems that need solving."
why-have-a-system,clip-08,15,"Q: Why is it important for salespeople to have a selling process?
A: Salespeople without a selling process tend to revert to the prospect's buying system, which puts them at a disadvantage. Having a selling process that is more powerful than the prospect's buying system is essential to win the majority of the time."
why-have-a-system,clip-08,16,"Q: What does the budget step involve in the Sandler Selling System?

why-have-a-system,clip-09,17,"Q: What is 'Wimp Junction' in the context of sales?
A: Wimp Junction is the critical point in a sales call where a salesperson decides whether to follow their own sales system or the prospect's system. Choosing the prospect's system leads to losing control of the sale and often results in failure."
why-have-a-system,clip-09,18,"Q: How can a salesperson avoid ending up at Wimp Junction?
A: By following their own sales system, practicing the Sandler selling system, and maintaining control of the sales process instead of defaulting to the prospect's system."
